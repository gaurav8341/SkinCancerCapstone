# SkinCancerCapstone

This project aims to create a classification model for the skin cancer lesion classification. 
The data used for this project is HAM10000 dataset which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000)

In the `Data Exploration` notebook, the data is visualized and prepared for the actual model training like data splitting, upsampling.

In the `Model Creation` notebook, the transfer learning based approach is used to develop an actual model.
